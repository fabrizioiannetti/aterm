# Another Terminal

This is a terminal based on the eclipse TM terminal, part of CDT.

The terminal bundle code (part of it, mostly the control) has been copied here.

The libraries necessary to run it are included in the `lib/` folder.

## Run

A launch configuration (named "Terminal") is part of the project (see `dev/` folder) and should be automatically
available from the Run menu.
